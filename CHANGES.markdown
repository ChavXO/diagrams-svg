1.0.1.3 (6 February 2014)
-------------------------

    - require diagrams-lib >= 1.0.1 (for Hashable SizeSpec2D instance)

1.0.1.2 (4 February 2014)
-------------------------

    - Allow `blaze-markup-0.6`

1.0.1.1 (30 January 2014)
-------------------------

    - Work around a bug in GHC 7.4.2, which chokes when deriving Generic
      instances for associated data types.

1.0.1 (26 January 2014)
-----------------------

    - Add `Hashable (Options SVG R2)` instance
    - Remove `Show (Options SVG R2)` instance

    According to the PVP, these changes should require a major version
    bump.  However, a major version bump would be quite annoying and I
    don't expect these instance changes to affect anyone (the changes
    were made for internal reasons).  Please yell if it does affect
    you.

1.0 (24 November 2013)
----------------------

    - Re-implement via new backend `RTree` interface, leading to
      smaller output files.
    - Use new command-line interface from `diagrams-lib`.
    - Export `B` as an alias for `SVG` token
